  * InteractivePlot notebook is currently the most useful to interact with. This Binder [link](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/ucla-its/curb-analysis-visuals/master?urlpath=%2Fapps%2FInteractivePlot-v3.ipynb) loads that notebook directly, automatically preparing the interactive visualization.
  * Other features of the new curbdata module, including summary statistics, aggregations, and static plotting, are demonstrated [here](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/ucla-its/curb-analysis-visuals/master?urlpath=%2Fnotebooks%2FSummaryStats.ipynb).
